There was an error that occurred within my for loops about "unsigned" ints. The error message was corrected
by adding unsigned in the for loops. Another "undeclared identifier" error occurred with enumeration but
I could not find a solid solution, so I re-declared the enumerated values in the .cpp file.

When the wrong arguments were put into the command line, there would be no printed sequence of words and
the return should be 1.
